# kanji-clask

**kanji-clask** is an arcade-style game where players must escape from a pursuing monster by accurately drawing Kanji symbols. With each correct drawing, your character receives a temporary speed boost that helps you widen the gap between you and the monster. As the game progresses, the Kanji become more challenging and the monster's pursuit grows more relentless, testing your precision and quick thinking.

## Features

- **Unique Kanji Drawing Mechanic:**  
  Draw a sequence of Kanji symbols presented as a stack. Accuracy is key—each correct symbol helps you escape.

- **Dynamic Monster Chase:**  
  A persistent monster chases your character. Each successfully drawn symbol temporarily boosts your speed and creates a safe gap.

- **Combo & Scoring System:**  
  Earn points for every correct Kanji, with bonus scores for consecutive successes.

- **Increasing Difficulty:**  
  As you progress, the Kanji become more complex and the monster's speed increases, raising the challenge.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Built for both desktop and mobile devices, supporting mouse and touch inputs.

## Gameplay

In **kanji-clask**, your character is relentlessly pursued by a monster. Your goal is to quickly and accurately replicate the Kanji symbols displayed on-screen. Each correct symbol triggers a speed boost, helping you keep the monster at bay. If you miss a symbol or draw it inaccurately, the monster gets closer—and if it catches you, it's game over.

### Core Mechanics

- **Kanji Drawing:**  
  A stack of Kanji symbols is presented on-screen. You must draw them in the correct order with precision.

- **Boost Activation:**  
  Successfully drawing each symbol triggers a temporary boost that increases the distance between your character and the monster.

- **Monster Chase:**  
  The monster continuously advances and its speed increases over time, demanding quick and accurate drawing.
